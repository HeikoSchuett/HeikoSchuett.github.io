	<h1>Hi there, I'm Heiko Schütt</h1>
	<p style="float: right;"><img src="images/me.jpg" width="200px" alt=""></p>
	<p> I am associate professor for computational cognitive science and modeling at the Université du Luxembourg. I create models of visual perception and related cognition and behavior based on mechanistic models like deep neural networks and statistical considerations like Bayesian inference and efficient coding. Furthermore, I develop methods to evaluate such models and published two popular toolboxes for such evaluations: Psignifit 4 and rsatoolbox.
		 Before that, I was a PostDoc with <a href="https://www.cns.nyu.edu/malab/">Weiji Ma</a> at NYU and <a href="https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/nikolaus-kriegeskorte-phd">Niko Kriegeskorte</a> at the Zuckerman Institute at Columbia.
         For my PhD, I worked with Felix Wichmann in Tübingen and Ralf Engbert in Potsdam on early visual processing and eye movements respectively. </p>
