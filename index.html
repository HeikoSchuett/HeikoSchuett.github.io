	<h1>Hi there, I'm Heiko Schütt</h1>
	<p style="float: right;"><img src="images/me.jpg" width="300px" alt=""></p>
	<p>I am a PostDoc with <a href="https://www.cns.nyu.edu/malab/">Weiji Ma</a> at NYU and Niko Kriegeskorte at the Zuckerman Institute at Columbia.
My research focusses on Models and Methods for vision research. For his PhD I worked with Felix Wichmann in Tübingen and Ralf Engbert in Potsdam on early visual processing and eye movements respectively. 
Now I work on models for perceptual organization and on methods for high dimensional representational models of higher visual processing like deep neural networks models. </p>
